## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

    Hinge

* When was the company incorporated?

    The company was founded in 2012, but launched the mobile version in 2013. (1.)

* Who are the founders of the company?

    Justin McLeod is the founder and CEO of the company. (1.)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    Justin, the founder of the company, got dumped by the "love of his life" after college. His heartbreak inspired him to create an app to help people meet others and fall in love. His college love ended up giving him another chance, and this prompted him to re-design Hinge from scratch. (1.)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Hinge has raised a total of $26.8 million over 5 rounds of Series A funding. The last round of funding was in December of 2014, and was $17.5 million. (2.)

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    Hinge is the "Dating App Designed to Be Deleted". Unlike some other apps that are thought to promote "hook up" culture, Hinge is a more relationship oriented app that focuses on personality based matching. (3.)

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

    Hinge's customer base is single people looking for relationships, whether long term or short term. Hinge is a dating app for people of all sexualities and genders, and all ages. A 2022 study by the Pew Research Center found that 30% of U.S. adults have used a dating site or app. Further, 53% of U.S. adults ages 18-29 report having used a dating site or app. For Hinge specifically, 39% of U.S. adults ages 18-29 report having used Hinge at least one time. (4.)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Hinge stands out from other popular dating apps because it's not just a swipe-based app. The algorithm dives a bit deeper- Individuals reach out to each other using likes or comments, which makes it a more personal approach/allows for a more natural and meaningful way to reach out to someone that you're interested in. It allows you to create very detailed profiles with pictures, voice prompts, video prompts, conversation prompts, personal details (height, drug use/drinking, work, politics, etc.), and information about your dating intentions (if you're looking for long-term, short-term, not sure, etc.). (5.)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    Dating apps are very secretive as to how their algorithms work,but there is some basic information out there on how algorithms are implemented. Hinge uses the Nobel prize winning Gale-Shapley algorithm to help make matches. Gale and Shapley actually used marriage/relationships as an example for illustrating the algorithm. They analyzed how 10 (example number) men and 10 women should be matched while still taking into account their preferences. In match-making, the algorithm can be set up in 2 ways, with either the men or the women making the first move/proposal. For example, if all of the women make the first move, in the first round the women will propose to the man they like the most. The men will then analyze the proposals they recieve, retain the one they like the most (but not accept yet), and reject the rest. In the second round, the women who were rejected in the first round propose again to their second choice, and again the men will analyze their options and retain their favorite choice. The process continues until all of the women don't want to make further proposals, and each man accepts the proposal he chose. (6.)

    Hinge uses collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze a user's preferences and behaviors, compare them to others, and then give you potential matches based on what similar users like or dislike. The algorithms are similar to algorithms used by companies like Netflix or Max to determine and show you shows/movies you might like. (7.) The Gale-Shapley algorithm is implemented in Hinge's "Most Compatible" feature. The "Most Compatible" feature uses machine learning and a user's data to figure out a user's preferences and highlight profiles that are likely to be a good match. Hinge's technology analyzes users based on who has liked them, and who they have liked, and finds patterns in those likes. For the "Most Compatible" feature/section, the people recommended to a user will also be recommended that user in their Most Compatible section on the same day, and these selections expire/change every 24 hours. (8.) However, to reach out to their "Most Compatible" options, users must send them a "Rose" rather than just a like or comment, and users only get one Rose per week, unless you pay for more (currently costs $9.99 for 3 more Roses, or you get discounts for buying 12 or 50 Roses). In this way, Hinge encourages users to pay/pay more to be able to interact with the people they deem to be most compatible for them.

    Hinge and Hinge's algorithms offer even more perks to users willing to pay more. For example, users can pay $9.99 for a "Boost", which claims to show your profile to 11 times more people for one hour. You can also pay $14.99 per week for Hinge+, which gives a user unlimited likes and other perks. Or for $24.99 per week, HingeX supposedly helps you "get recommended sooner" and gives you "access to people more your type." (7.)


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

    Social Media/Dating

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

    There has been a massive increase in the use of AI in dating apps and new features that they offer. There's been a myriad of developments in the recent decade, with the introduction of algorithms to help with the matchmaking process, like Hinge using the Gale-Shapley algorithm. But one more specific and recent example is Tinder's AI Photo Selector. A user will either uploading a selfie or a picture with their face in it, and it scans the photos in your camera roll. It analyzes the photos based on lighting, composition, filters out group photos, and pictures that don't abide by their community guidelines, and suggests possible profile picture for the user to choose from. This helps users narrow down what picture they may want to feature as their profile picture if they're struggling to decide. (9.)

    Several dating app platforms, like Grindr and Tinder, are using AI to implement safety precautions and to identify harmful messages and content that does not adhere to their community and safety guidelines. Grindr also alerts users of possible threats in their area, which has proven to be especially important fot the LGBTQ+ community in the U.S. and abroad, where the community faces more threats. (10.)

    Most dating apps also use AI to validate user's identities when they're signing up and making their profiles, to help avoid the issue of "catfishing" and the potential dangers there are behind it. I remember when I used Hinge, I had to do a face scan to validate that I was the person in my pictures. By taking this step, Hinge and other dating sites are helping ensure that users have a safer dating experience online.

* What are the other major companies in this field?

    Technically, Hinge is now under the domain of Match Group, which owns Hinge, Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Match.com, and other apps. However two other major companies in the field are Bumble and Grindr. (7.)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    According to Business of Apps, Hinge had a revenue of $396 million in 2023, which was a 39% increase from the year prior. In 2017 annual revenue was $2 million, and $8 million in 2018, and quickly grew year over year. As of 2023, there are 28 million users on Hinge, with 1.4 million users paying for premium accounts and services. (11.) Hinge reports they had 1.2 million paying users in Q2 of 2023, and the number continues to rise. (7.)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

    As far as I looked, I could not find any information about specific core metrics/goals that Hinge and other companies have and use to measure success. However, I would refer to their revenue and number of users in the question above, as well as the information below about their marketshare and how Hinge compares to competitors.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

    According to Business of Apps, Hinge has a 15% marketshare of the U.S. dating app market. (11.) The previously mentioned Pew Research Center study found that one out of 5 online daters in the United States uses Hinge. (4.) A recent (July 11, 2024) article in CBS News stated that Hinge is the "best modern dating app overall". (5.) It seems that all of the dating apps have a "reputation" of what they help people find, and Hinge is quickly gaining notoriety, especially for users ages 18-29.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    I would recommend that Hinge start offering to match people based on first date preference (maybe ask people to select first date ideas they might be interested in and other parameters, and then suggest matches). I would also recommend implementing an optional AI dating coach that can give suggestions on conversation starters, date ideas, etc. to help guide people who would like to use it.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    I think the first date matching would really help people find others with true common interests, which can sometimes be hard to portray on a dating profile. I also think it would be a fun addition that users would really enjoy, and increase engagement and use of the app. The AI dating coach (and the first date matching) would bring something unique to Hinge and give it more of an edge against other competitors.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    I think they could tweak/add to their existing algorithms for matching to incorporate a first date feature/preference. In general I would use a recommendor/matching model used for semi-real time inference. For the dating coach idea, they could implement an AI chat feature based on data they've already been collecting on people's preferences and how they behave.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    Hinge has already done a great job of continuing to hone their algorithms and differentiate their offering, so I think they're on a great path for making more advancements in their AI accomplishments
